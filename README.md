GAME DESCRIPTION:

The main action of the game is moving around to hit buttons.
The hardest part of working with unreal was learning a completely different style of coding. At the start I found it difficult to relate what I was doing in unreal to writing object oriented code in Java, which I am most used to. After spending time working on my game I was able to understand the equivalent of what I was doing to working in Java, which made it understand and process how to do things in unreal. Then after even more time everything became even more familiar and I found that I wasn't thinking of how to do something in Java, then 'translating' it into Unreal, I was thinking directly in terms of Unreal.
The most interesting part of my game is mastering the movement physics. It's fun to get better at controlling the character's running and jumping so you can move quickly to exactly where you want to go to hit all the buttons.
